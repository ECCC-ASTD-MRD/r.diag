      AUTHORS - R.Laprise, S.J.Lambert, B.Dugas, JUN 23/83.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/chabin.ptn,v 4.14 2014/09/25 20:20:46 dugas Exp $
       
 
      PURPOSE...
       CONVERT A STANDARD CCRN FILE FROM CHARACTER TO BINARY FORM.
 
 
      DESCRIPTION...
       THE CHAR CHARACTER FILE SHOULD HAVE BE OF BLOCKED FIXED 
       LENGTH RECORDS OF LENGTH 80 FOR PORTABILITY.  chabin CAN ACCOUNT
       FOR THE PACKING DENSITY BY EMULATING THE ACTUAL UNPACKING PROCESS
       AND THIS IS THE DEFAULT WORKING MODE. IT WILL THEN START THE PROCESS
       AFTER THE DATA TRANSFER INTO FULL WORDS IS DONE, SO THAT IF THE DATA
       WAS PACKED, THE INPUT IS HEXADECIMAL. UNPACKED DATA ARE READ WITH A
       '(1P5E15.6,5X)' FIXED FORMAT. NEGATIVE PACKING DENSITIES ARE ALSO
       SUPPORTED.
 
       NOTES: 1) THE FIST LINE OF EACH RECORD HAS TO CONTAIN A
                 STANDARD 8-WORD CCRN HEADER AND IS READ WITH
                 A '(1X,A4,I10,1X,A4,5I10)' FORMAT.
              2) THE -def PARAMETRE KEY SELECTS THE OLDER NON-PACKING
                 OPERATING MODE, WHERE DATA IS ALWAYS READ AS IF IT WERE
                 UNPACKED. THE PROGRAM IS THEN SAID TO BE RUNNING IN (BACWARD)
                 COMPATIBILITY MODE.
              3) THE INPUT FORMAT CAN ALSO BE CHANGED BY SUPPLYING
                 AN ALTERNATE VALUE WITH THE -def PARAMETRE KEY, AS IN
                              -def '(1P6E15.6,5X)'
                 WHERE THE SINGLE QUOTES ARE NOT OPTIONAL FEATURES.
                 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       CHAR = UPPER-CASE CHARACTER VERSION OF A CCC FORMAT FILE
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       BIN  = THE BINARY VERSION OF THE SAME FILE
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 RECORD SIZE TOO LARGE
        2 FILE CHAR SEEMS EMPTY (ERROR WHILE READING FIRST LINE)
        3 ERROR WHILE READING NUMERICAL DATA
        4 ERROR WHILE READING LABEL DATA
