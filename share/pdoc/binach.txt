      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/binach.ptn,v 4.17 2014/09/25 20:20:45 dugas Exp $
       
 
      PURPOSE...
       CONVERT A  STANDARD CCRN  FILE FROM BINARY  TO CHARACTER FORM.
 
 
      DESCRIPTION...
       THE CHAR CHARACTER FILE SHOULD BE DECLARED OF BLOCKED FIXED 
       LENGTH RECORDS OF LENGTH 80 FOR PORTABILITY.  binach CAN ACCOUNT
       FOR THE PACKING DENSITY BY EMULATING THE ACTUAL PACKING PROCESS
       AND THIS IS THE DEFAULT WORKING MODE. IT WILL THEN STOP THE
       PROCESS BEFORE THE DATA COMPRESSION INTO FULL WORDS IS DONE
       SO THAT IF THE DATA WAS PACKED, THE OUTPUT IS HEXADECIMAL.
       UNPACKED DATA ARE WRITTEN WITH A '(1P5E15.6,5X)' FIXED FORMAT.
       NEGATIVE PACKING DENSITIES ARE SUPPORTED.
 
       NOTES: 1) THE FIST LINE OF EACH RECORD WILL CONTAIN A
                 STANDARD 8-WORD CCRN HEADER AND WRITTEN WITH
                 A '(1X,A4,I10,1X,A4,5I10)' FORMAT.
              2) THE -def PARAMETRE KEY SELECTS THE OLDER NON-PACKING
                 OPERATING MODE, WHERE DATA IS ALWAYS WRITTEN AS IF IT WERE
                 UNPACKED. THE PROGRAM IS THEN SAID TO BE RUNNING IN (BACWARD)
                 COMPATIBILITY MODE.
              3) THE OUTPUT FORMAT CAN ALSO BE CHANGED BY SUPPLYING
                 AN ALTERNATE VALUE WITH THE -def PARAMETRE KEY, AS IN
                              -def '(1P6E15.6,5X)'
                 WHERE THE SINGLE QUOTES ARE NOT OPTIONAL FERATURES.
