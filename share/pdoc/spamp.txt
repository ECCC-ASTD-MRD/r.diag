      PURPOSE - FILE ARITHMETIC PROGRAM Y = SQROOT( X * CONJG(X) ),
                SO THAT Y IS THE COMPLEX AMPLITUDE OF X.
 
      NOTE    - X HAS TO BE COMPLEX.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       X = ANY COMPLEX ARRAY
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       Y = COMPLEX AMPLITUDE OF FILE X (IN REAL PART OF EACH COMPLEX WORD)
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 X CONTAINS NON-COMPLEX DATA
        2 ERROR READING X
        3 MORE THAN ONE SIZE IN X
