      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/subarea.ptn,v 4.12 2014/09/25 20:20:54 dugas Exp $
 
  
      PURPOSE - CONVERTS A FILE OF GAUSSIAN OR LAT-LON GRIDS TO A FILE OF POLAR
                STEREOGRAPHIC, GAUSSIAN OR LAT-LON GRIDS REPRESENTATIVE OF A 
                SUB-AREA OF THE GLOBE, BY LINEAR OR CUBIC INTERPOLATION. 
 
      NOTE (which applies only to CCCma files...)
              - IN ADDITION TO XOUT AND THE OUTPUT FILE, SUBAREA ALSO 
                WRITES CO-ORDINATE INFORMATION TO "pltinfo" FILE 
                (UNIT 45) TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY USED BY GGPLOT. THIS
                NAME CANNOT BE REASSIGNED AND WILL RESIDE ON CURRENT
                DIRECTORY.
 
           ***  THE USER SHOULD CALL GGPLOT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SUBAREA 
                AND BEFORE CALLING SUBAREA AGAIN, (EXCEPT WHEN PLOTTIN 
                MULTIPLE FIELDS WITH A SINGLE CALL TO GGPLOT). 
 
  
      INPUT FILE...
       XIN  = FILE CONTAINING GAUSSIAN-GRID OR LAT-LONG FIELDS. 
  
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       XOUT = FILE CONTAINING POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC OR CARTESIAN FIELDS 
              REPRESENTING A SUB-AREA OF THE GLOBE. 
 
 
      PARAMETERS... 
  
       DLAT1,DLON1 = CARTESIAN COORDINATE IN DEGREES OF LOWER LEFT CORNER
                     OF PLOT. LATITUDES RANGE FROM -90 TO +90, FOR THE 
                     SOUTH AND NORTH POLES RESPECTIVELY. LONGITUDES RANGING
                     FROM -180 TO +180, WITH GREENWHICH MERIDIAN AT 0. 
       DLAT2,DLON2 = CARTESIAN COORDINATE IN DEGREES OF UPPER RIGHT CORNER
                     OF PLOT. COORDINATES NOT USED FOR DEFAULT P-S OUTPUT
       DGRW        = ANGLE OF GREENWHICH MERIDIAN OFF HORIZONTAL, 
                     NON-DEFAULT P-S OUTPUT ONLY. 
       LX          > 0, THE RESOLUTION OF THE INTERPOLATED P-S OUTPUT FILE
                        LX GRID POINTS ARE USED ALONG THE X-AXIS, WITH THE
                        SAME RESOLUTION USED ALONG Y-AXIS. 
                        VALUES OF 30 TO 110 ARE SUGGESTED.

                   USED FOR NON-DEFAULT P-S OUTPUT, AND WHEN LX= 0 OR -5 
                   IF XIN CONTAINS HEMISPHERIC DATA, THE DEFAULT NHEM

                   THIS PARAMETRE IS IGNORED FOR RPN/CMC FILES.
       NOUTYP      = 0, OUTPUT FILE IS ON A SUBSET OF THE INPUT CARTESIAN
                        GRID. CHOSEN COORDINATES ARE ADJUSTED TO THE 
                        NEAREST COORDINATES ON THE INPUT GRID. THE
                        OUTPUT THEN IS KNOWN AS A L-TYPE GRID.
                   OTHERWISE, OUTPUT FILE IS INTERPOLATED TO A P-S 
                        PROJECTION WITH RESOLUTION LX.
