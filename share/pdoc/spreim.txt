      PURPOSE - FILE PROGRAM Y = REAL (X) AND Z = IMAG (X).
 
      NOTE    - 1) X MUST BE COMPLEX.
                2) Y AND Z ARE RETURNED AS REAL PARTS OF COMPLEX FIELDS
                   HAVING THE SAME SIZE AS X.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       X = ANY COMPLEX ARRAY (MAX grille_maximale / 2 COMPLEX WORDS)
 
      OUTPUT FILES...
       Y = COMPLEX FIELD CONTAINING (REAL(X),0.)
       Z = COMPLEX FIELD CONTAINING (IMAG(X),0.)
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 ERROR READING X
        2 X CONTAINS NON-COMPLEX DATA
