       spzxmlt - MULTIPLY SPECTRAL FILE BY CROSS-SECTION FILE
 
 
      AUTHORS  - T.Shepherd AND J.D.Henderson, JUL 18/79.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/spzxmlt.ptn,v 4.7 2014/09/25 20:20:54 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE - MULTIPLIES A COMPLEX-VALUED SPECTRAL COEFFICIENT 
                FILE (SPIN)BY A GLOBALLY-AVERAGED ZONAL CROSS-SECTION
                FILE (ZXIN) WITH THE SAME VERTICAL LEVEL STRUCTURE. 
                ZXIN FILE SHOULD BE CONSTANT BY LEVEL, AS ONLY THE
                FIRST VALUE OF EACH IS USED.
 
      NOTE    - FOR EXAMPLE, THE FILES COULD BE ON PRESSURE LEVELS, AND
                THE ZONAL FILE COULD BE THE GLOBAL AVERAGE OF DEL-HAT.
 
 
      INPUT FILES...
       SPIN  = SPECTRAL MULTI-LEVEL FILE.
       ZXIN  = GLOBAL AVERAGE CROSS-SECTION FILE CORRESPONDING TO SPIN.
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       SPOUT = SPECTRAL FILE OF SPIN MULTIPLIED BY ZXIN.
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
       0 NO PROBLEMS
       1 SPIN,ZXIN FILE PROBLEMS
       2 PROBLEMS READING ZXIN
       3 DIFFERENT VERTICAL LEVELS IN SPIN,ZXIN
