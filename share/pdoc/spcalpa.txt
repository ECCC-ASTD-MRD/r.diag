      PURPOSE  - PRODUCES A COMPLEX FILE (OUT) OF THE FACTOR C-ALPHA=N(N+1);
                (CMPLX(N*(N+1),0.)), WHERE N IS THE LEGENDRE POLYNOMIAL

      NOTE     - ONE RECORD IS PRODUCED FOR EACH RECORD IN THE INPUT
                 FILE (IN).
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       IN = FILE OF COMPLEX COEFFICIENTS.
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       OUT = COMPLEX FILE CONTAINING THE REQUIRED VALUES FOR EACH
             RECORD OF THE INPUT FILE (IN).
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
