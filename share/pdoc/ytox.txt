      DESCRIPTION...
       A FILE ARITHMETIC PROGRAM WHICH...
 
       ... PRODUCES FILE Z = Y**X
 
 
      NOTES:  1) X AND Y MAY CONTAIN REAL OR COMPLEX DATA.
              2) FOR REAL DATA, THAT OF Y CANNOT BE NEGATIVE.
              3) 0**0 = 1, RATHER THAN BE INDETERMINATE.
              4) 0**X = 0, WHEN X.NE.0.
              5) WHEN THE THE NAMES OF CORRESPONDING VARIABLES
                 IN X AND Y ARE DIFFERENT, THE PROGRAM WILL REPLACE
                 THEN WITH 'YTOX', INDICATING THAT THIS OPERATION WAS
                 PERFORMED. THIS DEFAULT BEHAVIOR CAN BE AVOIDED BY
                 SPECIFYING THE "-name" COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT WITH
                 A VALUE OF THE ORDINAL OF THE INPUT FILE WHOSE
                 NAMES SHOULD BE KEPT.

        1 NOT AS MANY ARRAYS IN FILE Y AS IN FILE X
        2 MORE THAN ONE SIZE FOR ARRAYS IN X AND/OR Y
