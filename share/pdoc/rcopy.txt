      DESCRIPTION...
       COPY LOGICAL RECORDS FROM RECORD NUMBERS N1 TO N2 INCLUSIVE
 
       Note: A logical record is here understood to be the storage
             unit holding a single variable at a single level.
             As such, a physical record can include several
             such logical records. Multi-level zonal
             records are examples of this.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       XIN  = INPUT FILE (REAL OR COMPLEX)
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       XOUT = RECORDS FROM RECORD NUMBERS N1 TO N2
 
 
      PARAMETERS...
 
       N1     (a)    = FIRST LOGICAL RECORD TO BE COPIED
       N2     (b)    = LAST LOGICAL RECORD TO BE COPIED ( N1 <= N2 )
       NEWNAM (name) = NEW NAME FOR OUTPUT LABEL. BLANK KEEPS OLD NAME
                
       Note: N1 AND N2 BOTH NEED BE GREATER THAN ZERO SINCE
             THE ORDINAL OF THE FIRST RECORD IN XIN IS 1.
