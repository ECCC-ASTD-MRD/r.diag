      PURPOSE - COMPUTES THE SPHERICAL HARMONIC COEFFICIENTS OF A TERM OF
                THE FORM V DOT GRAD X FROM THE GLOBAL SPHERICAL HARMONIC
                COEFFICIENTS OF U, V, AND X.
      NOTES   - 1) MANY APPLICATIONS OF THIS PROGRAM WILL REQUIRE THE
                   DIVERGENCE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE WIND FIELD.
                2) MAXIMUM DIMENSIONS ARE 1999 GAUSSIAN LONGITUDES
                   AND 999 GAUSSIAN LATITUDES.
                3) THE PROGRAM ASSUMES THAT THE SPU VARIABLE NAME BE
                   EITHER 'U' OR 'UU'. FOR SPV, THE CHOICES ARE 'V'
                   OR 'VV'. IF THESE NAMES ARE 'UU' AND 'VV', A KNOTS
                   TO M/S CONVERSION FACTOR IS APPLIED TO SPOUT.
 
 
      INPUT FILES...
       SPU   = GLOBAL SPECTRAL MODEL WIND U-COMPONENT
       SPV   = GLOBAL SPECTRAL MODEL WIND V-COMPONENT
       SPX   = GLOBAL SPECTRAL FIELDS OF SOME VARIABLE.
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       SPOUT = GLOBAL SPECTRAL COEFF OF V DOT GRAD X.
 
 
      INPUT PARAMETERS...
 
       ILAT (-lat) = NUMBER OF LATITUDES IN THE TRANSFORM GAUSSIAN GRID.
       LON  (-lon) = LENGTH OF A GAUSSIAN GRID ROW.
