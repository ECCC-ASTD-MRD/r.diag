       gsmslph - COMPUTES MEAN-SEA-LEVEL PRESSURE FROM HYBRID T, LNSP, PHIS

      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/gsmslph.ptn,v 4.9 2014/09/25 20:20:49 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE - FROM A SERIES OF HYBRID LEVEL TEMPERATURES (=GSTEMP) AND
                LN(PS) (=GLNSP), COMPUTE  A  SERIES  OF  MEAN-SEA-LEVEL
                PRESSURES (=GPMSL), USING THE MOUNTAIN FIELD PHIS (=GPHIS).
 
 
      INPUT FILES...
       GSTEMP = HYBRID LEVEL GRID SETS OF TEMPERATURE (DEG K).
       GSLNSP = CORRESPONDING GRIDS OF LN(SF.PRES.)
       GPHIS  = GRID OF SURFACE GEOPOTENTIAL.
      (EXCLUSIVELY FOR GAL-CHEN LEVELS SUCH AS IN THE RCM MODEL)
       GSLNPT = SET OF LN(PRESSURE) ON THERMODYNAMIC LEVELS.
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       GPMSL  = MEAN-SEA-LEVEL PRESSURE GRIDS (IN MB).
 
 
      INPUT PARAMETERS...
 
       GAM    (a)    = LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATE (DEFAULT .0065).
       NLVLUP (n)    = NUMBER OF LEVELS BETWEEN REFERENCE
                       AND LOWEST LEVEL TEMP (DEFAULT 1).
       LAY    (l)    = LAYERING SCHEME USED IN MODEL (DEFAULT 3).
       COORD  (kind) = VERTICAL COORDINATE (ETA, SIG OR GAL-CHEN).
       PLID   (b)    = MODEL "LID" IN PASCALS (DEFAULT 500.)
 
       NOTE THAT LAY AND PLID ARE NOT USED FOR GAL-CHEN LEVELS.
