       parmsub - PARAMETER SUBSTITUTION PROGRAM 
 
 
      AUTHORS  - R.Laprise, B.Dugas AND J.D.Henderson, MAY 15/83.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/parmsub.ptn,v 4.3 2014/09/25 20:20:51 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE  - PARAMETER SUBSTITUTION PROGRAM. 
                 ANY CHARACTER STRING ENCLOSED IN A PAIR OF DOLLAR SIGNS IN 
                 FILE "IN" IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE NAME OF A PARAMETER TO BE 
                 REPLACED IN FILE "OUT" BY A SUBSTITUTION VALUE FROM FILE "IN2 
 
      NOTES    - 1) ONLY FILE "IN" IS REWOUND DURING EXECUTION.
                 2) OUTPUT IS ON FILE "OUT" FOR ALL PARAMETER SETS. 
                 3) IF A FATAL ERROR OCCURS IN ANY SET,THE PROGRAM ABORTS. 
 
 
      INPUT FILES... 
       IN    = INPUT FILE WITH (256 CHARACTERS MAX) LINES CONTAINING STRING(S)
               ENCLOSED IN A PAIR OF DOLLAR SIGNS. TWO CONSECUTIVE DOLLAR SIGNS
               ARE REPLACED BY ONE OF 36 CHARACTERS SPECIFIED IN SUBROUTINE
               PARINS, BASED ON THE SUBSTITUTION SET NUMBER. THREE CONSECUTIVE
               DOLLAR SIGNS MEANS THAT A DOLLAR SIGNS IS TO BE LEFT IN OUT.
               
       IN2   = INPUT FILE CONTAINING VALUES OF THE FORM  "NAME=VALUE," (THE
               COMMA IS PART OF THE SYNTAX).  THERE CAN BE MANY SUBSTITUTION 
               VALUES ON A CARD.  DO NOT USE THE CHARACTER ASCII(3C), i.e. "<".
               A SUBSTITUTION CARD WHICH STARTS WITH ",=X " IN COLUMNS 1 TO 4 
               CHANGES THE SEPARATOR FROM COMMA TO THE CHARACTER X FOR THAT 
               CARD ONLY.  THIS PERMITS THE INSERTION  OF VALUES THAT CONTAIN
               COMMAS.  IF A NAME IS REDEFINED, THE LAST VALUE IS USED. MORE
               THAN ONE SUBSTITUTION SET CAN BE READ.  THEY ARE THEN SEPARATED 
               BY A SLASH CARD ("/" IN COLUMN 1). THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE THAN
               A MAXIMUM OF 999 NAMES IN A SET.
 
      OUTPUT FILE... 
       OUT   = CONTAINS THE SUBSTITUTED FILE UPON TERMINATION. 
               OUTPUT IS ON FILE OUT FOR ALL PARAMETER SETS. 
 
 
      EXAMPLE OF INPUT/OUTPUT FILES... 
 
       INPUT FILE IN... 
                            "A $B$ CD $E$ F"
       INPUT FILE IN2... 
                            "B=XY,  E=Z,"
       OUTPUT FILE OUT... 
                            "A XY CD Z F"
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 NO SUBSTITUTION SET FOUND ON FILE IN2
        2 ABORT DUE TO ERROR(S) IN PARAMETER INSERTION
        3 FILE IN SEEMS EMPTY
        4 TOO MANY PARAMETER NAMES (FROM PARDEC)
        5 INCOMPLETE LINE IMAGE    (FROM PARINS)
