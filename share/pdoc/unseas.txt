      DESCRIPTION...
       THIS PROGRAM WILL REMOVE THE FIRST COMPONENT OF A TIME SERIES 
       FOURIER EXPANSION  AND THE COMPONENTS OF THE ANNUAL CYCLE AND 
       IT'S FIRST  "X" HARMONICS. THE MEAN  IS PUT TO ZERO WHILE THE 
       OTHER COMPONENTS ARE GIVEN THE AVERAGE VALUES OF THEIR PRECE- 
       DING AND FOLLOWING COMPONENTS. 
 
       THE ONLY INPUT REQUIRED IS THE NUMBER OF ANNUAL CYCLES REPRE- 
       SENTED BY THE DATA AND WHO MANY HARMONICS TO MODIFY. 
 
       NO  CHECK IS  MADE OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT THE DATA HAS TO BE 
       COMPLEX AND THAT THE FIRST FIELD IS LONG ENOUGH ... 
 
 
      PARAMETRE...
       CY (i) = NUMBER OF FULL ANNUAL CYCLES IN DATA
       X  (j) = NUMBER OF ANNUAL CYCLE HARMONICS TO ELIMINATE
