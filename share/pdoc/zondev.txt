       zondev  - COMPUTES ZONAL DEVIATIONS OF A GRID SET 
       zonvdev - COMPUTES ZONAL DEVIATIONS OF A SET OF WINDS
  
 
      AUTHOR  - J.D.Henderson, NOV 5/80.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/zondev.ptn,v 4.14 2014/09/25 20:20:57 dugas Exp $
 
  
      PURPOSE - COMPUTES A SET OF LAT-LON GRIDS CONTAINING DEVIATIONS
                FROM THE PRECOMPUTED ZONAL MEANS AND SAVES THEM ON FILE
                GGDEV. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LEVELS IS 999. 
 
      NOTES: 1) zonvdev ACCOUNTS FOR WIND ROTATIONS AS REQUIRED. IF NO
                SUCH OPERATION IS CALLED FOR, zondev CAN BE USED INSTEAD.
                IN PRACTICE, ROTATIONS ARE ONLY DONE FOR GEM Z-TYPE GRIDS.
             2) FURTHERMORE, IF ggvecz HAS ALLREADY BEEN APPLIED TO THE
                VECTOR COMPONENTS, zonvdev SHOULD **NOT** BE USED, AS
                THE RESULT WILL BE IN ERROR. PLEASE USE zondev IN
                THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.
  
 
      INPUT FILES (zondev)...
       GGIN  = MULTI-LEVEL SET OF LAT-LON GRIDS. 
       ZMIN  = "CORRESPONDING" SERIES OF ZONAL MEAN CROSS-SECTIONS. 
 
      INPUT FILES (zonvdev)...
       UG    = MULTI-LEVEL SET OF U LAT-LON GRIDS. 
       ZU    = "CORRESPONDING" SERIES OF ZONAL MEAN CROSS-SECTIONS. 
       VG    = MULTI-LEVEL SET OF V LAT-LON GRIDS. 
       ZV    = "CORRESPONDING" SERIES OF ZONAL MEAN CROSS-SECTIONS. 
 
      Note that in the current context, "CORRESPONDING" means that
      GGIN and ZMIN records with the same ordinal have the same time
      information, the same variable names, vertical level as well
      as the same number of latitudes. The same holds for the
      (UG,VG) and (ZU,ZV) pairs of wind components.
  
      MISSING VALUE TREATMENT IS SUPPORTED VIA EITHER THE "MISSING_VALUE"
      ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE OR THE "-mvalue" COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT. PLEASE
      SEE THE R.DIAG WEB DOCUMENTAION FOR MORE DETAILS.
 
 
      OUTPUT FILE (zondev)... 
       GGDEV = LAT-LON GRIDS OF DEVIATIONS FROM THE ZONAL MEANS. 
 
      OUTPUT FILE (zonvdev)... 
       UGDEV = LAT-LON GRIDS OF U DEVIATIONS FROM THE ZONAL MEANS. 
       VGDEV = LAT-LON GRIDS OF V DEVIATIONS FROM THE ZONAL MEANS.
