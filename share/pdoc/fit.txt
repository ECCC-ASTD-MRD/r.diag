      DESCRIPTION...
       TIME SERIES POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION FIT, DISPLAY & STATISTICAL TESTING
 
 
      PURPOSE - FIT DOES A SERIES OF POLYNOMIAL REGRESION AND STATISTICAL
                TESTING THEREOF. SEE (BENNETT & FRANKLIN, 1962, JOHN WILEY
                PUB., P. 244, 255-257) FOR EXACT REFERENCE ON THE METHOD.
                IT ALSO PLOTS THE RESULTS.
 
      NOTES 1 ) THE PLOTTED VALUES HAVE THE MEAN OF THE INPUT RECORD
                REMOVED FROM THEM. BUT THIS REMOVED VALUE CAN ALSO
                BE WRITTEN TO OUTPUT AND IT IS RE-INCLUDED WHEN THE
                POLYNOM OUTPUT FILE IS REQUESTED.
            2 ) THE (OPTIONALY) PRINTED TEST STATISTICS FOLLOW A
                T-DISTRIBUTION WITH N-K-1 DEGREES OF FREEDOM. THEY
                INDICATE WETHER THE CORRESPONDING COEFFICIENT IS
                SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM ZERO.
            3 ) THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF POINTS THAT WILL BE PLOTTED IS 500.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       SERIES = A SET OF VALID TIME SERIES (NO CHECKING IS DONE FOR THIS)
 
      (OPTIONAL) OUTPUT FILE...
       POLYNOM = THE CORRESPONDING SET OF FITTED TIME SERIES
  
 
      PARAMETERS...
 
       K (a) = THE MAXIMUM DEGREE OF THE POLYNOMIAL FIT TO THE DATA. THIS
               IS DEFAULTED TO 2. THIS NUMBER IS SMALLER OR EQUAL TO 5.
 
       N (b) = THE NUMBER OF BUNCHED POINTS TO BE USED IN THE ANALYSIS AND
               DISPLAY. THE DEFAULT VALUE OF N IS THE ACTUAL LENGTH OF ONE
               DATA RECORD.
 
       KIND  = CONTROLS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO BE WRITTEN TO STDOUT:
               0 = MINIMUM, 1 = BASIC STATISTICS, 2 = EVERYTHING.
               THE DEFAULT IS 1 WHEN POLYNOM IS SPECIFIED
               AND 2 WHEN IT IS NOT.
