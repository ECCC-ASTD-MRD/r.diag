      PURPOSE - CONVERTS GRID FILES OF TEMPERATURE AND DEW POINT
                DEPRESSION TO SPECIFIC AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY. 
 
      NOTES:  - 1) WATER AND ICE PHASES ARE CONSIDERED IN THE CONVERSION
                   WHEN THE COMMAND LINE PARAMETER "-def" IS SPECIFIED.
                   OTHERWISE, ONLY WATER PHASE IS CONSIDERED.
                2) CALCULATIONS ARE DONE WITH THE RPN PHYSIC'S SET
                   OF THERMODYNAMIC CONVERSION FUNCTIONS (I.E. FINTERN)
                   RATHER THAN THE FORMULAS USED IN CCRN MODEL SPW6.
                3) ZXRHUM WILL ONLY USE THE ZONAL AVERAGE COMPONENTS
                   OF THE INPUT ES AND TEMPERATURE.
 
 
      INPUT FILES... 
      (FOR gphum)
       ES   = DEW POINT DEPRESSION GRIDS.
       TEMP = TEMPERATURE GRIDS ON THE SAME LEVELS AS ES.
      [SP   = SURFACE PRESSURE (MB), ONLY USED WHEN COORD .NE. 'PRES'.
              NOTE THAT ITS ACCEPTED VARIABLE NAMES ARE 'P0' OR 'PS']
 
      (FOR zxrhum)
       ES   = PRESSURE LEVEL ARRAYS OF DEW POINT DEPRESSION. 
       TEMP = PRESSURE LEVEL ARRAYS OF TEMPERATURE
              ON THE SAME LEVELS AS ES.
 
      OUTPUT FILES... 
      (FOR gphum)
       SHUM = SPECIFIC HUMIDITY GRIDS.
       RHUM = RELATIVE HUMIDITY GRIDS.
      (FOR zxrhum)
       ZXRHUM = PRESSURE LEVEL CROSS-SECTION OF RELATIVE HUMIDITY.
 
 
      (COMMAND-LINE) INPUT PARAMETERS...
 
       COORD (kind) = 'SIG'/'GEM'/'GEM2'/'GEM3'/'PRES'.
       PTOIT (c)    = CONSTANT PRESSURE (PA) AT THE LID OF MODEL WHEN
                      (COORD.NE.'PRES') (DEF = pression_au_toit).
 
       The next two parametres are only used when COORD='GEM2' or 'GEM3'.
 
       PREF  (d)    = REF PRESSURE (DEF 80000 PA).
       R     (i)    = REFERENCE EXPONENT (DEF 1.0)
 
       Notes: 1) 'GEM' is the original gem eta coordinate, while 'GEM2' is
                 the first gem hybrid coordinate as implemented by Edouard
                 & Gravel in GEM/DM v2.2.0. 'GEM3' is the normalized version
                 that was implemented in the v2.3.1 GEM/DM.
              2) The default value of COORD is determined by the file type
                 and the program will also try to determine it by the
                 (internal) coding used for the coordinate itself.
              3) Specifying "-def AABB" will force the attempt to read
                 a text file called aabb.nml, containing a FORTRAN
                 namelist AABB_NML, which in turns will hold two arrays,
                 A and B such that the local pressure at level K, PL(K),
                 can be calculated as "A(K)+B(K)*PS". This then by-passes
                 all of the normal COORD-related calculations for PL(K).
