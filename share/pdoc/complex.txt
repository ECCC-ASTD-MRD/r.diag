      PURPOSE - MODE 1: FILE Y = REAL (X) AND Z = IMAG (X)
                MODE 2: FILE Z = CMPLX( X , Y )
 
      NOTES   - 1) THE MODE IS DETERMINED BY THE TYPE OF FILE X.
                   IF X IS OF TYPE COMPLEX ('SPEC', 'FOUR' OR 'CMPL'),
                   MODE 1 HOLDS. IF X IS OF TYPE REAL ('GRID' OR 'ZONL'),
                   MODE 2 HOLDS
                2) ALL OF THE OUTPUT GRID PARAMETERS ARE AS THE INPUT,
                   EXCEPT FOR THE TYPE WHICH MAY CHANGE TO/FROM
                   'GRID'/'SUBA'/'ZONL' AND 'CMPL'/'SPEC'/'FOUR'

       name = DEFINES THE VARIABLE NAMES USED IN OUTPUT FILE(S) IF
              THEY ARE TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN INPUT FILE(S).
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 ERROR READING X
        2 ERROR READING Y (MODE 2)
        3 X AND Y NOT THE SAME SIZE (MODE 2)
        4 UNSUPPORTED DATA TYPE IN X
        6 MORE RECORDS IN X THAN IN Y (MODE 2)
