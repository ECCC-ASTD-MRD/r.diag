      AUTHOR  - J.D.Henderson, APR 22/80.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/cwinds.ptn,v 4.15 2014/10/16 11:34:04 dugas Exp $
 
  
      PURPOSE - CONVERTS SPECTRAL VORTICITY (Q) AND DIVERGENCE (D) PAIRS
                TO MODEL WIND COMPONENTS (U,V)COS(LAT)/A. ALTERNATIVELY,
                PAIRS OF HORIZONTAL STREAMFUNCTION (PSI) AND VELOCITY
                POTENTIAL (CHI) CAN BE USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.
                ALL FIELDS ARE GLOBAL. 
 
      NOTE:     WHEN 1) THE SSVORT VARIABLE NAME IS 'QR' OR 'PP',
                OR 2) THE SSDIV VARIABLE NAME IS 'DD' OR 'CC', THEN
                THE SSU AND SSV OUTPUT VARIABLE NAMES ARE RESPECTIVELY
               'UU' AND 'VV' AND ARE IN UNITS OF KNOTS, THIS RATHER THAN
                THE DEFAULT 'U' AND 'V' IN UNITS OF M/S.
 
 
      INPUT FILES...  
       SSVORT = SPECTRAL VORTICITY  (OR HORIZONTAL STREAMFUNCTION)
       SSDIV  = SPECTRAL DIVERGENCE  (OR VELOCITY POTENTIAL)
  
      OUTPUT FILES...  
       SSU = SPECTRAL WIND COMPONENT U 
       SSV = SPECTRAL WIND COMPONENT V
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
 
      FATAL CONDITIONS...
        1 UNABLE TO READ SSVORT
        2 UNABLE TO READ SSDIV
        3 DATA NOT COMPLEX
        4 UNABLE TO UNPACK FIRST SSVORT
        5 NOT AS MANY RECORDS IN SSDIV AS IN SSVRT
        6 SSVORT AND SSDIV NOT THE SAME SIZE
        7 VARIABLE NAMES NOT RECOGNIZED
        8 UNABLE TO ALLOCATE WORKING MEMORY
 
      NON-FATAL CONDITIONS...
      101 CWINDS REQUIRES FULL SPECTRAL FIELDS TO OPERATE
