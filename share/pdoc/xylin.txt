      DESCRIPTION...
       A CCC FILE ARITHMETIC PROGRAM WHICH...
 
       ... PRODUCES FILE Z = A*X + B*Y + C
           (WHERE BOTH X AND Y MAY CONTAIN REAL OR COMPLEX DATA
            TYPES, BUT THEN C MUST BE 0.0).
 
 
      PARAMETERS...
 
       A    = REAL MULTIPLICATIVE CONSTANT FOR FILE X.
       B    = REAL MULTIPLICATIVE CONSTANT FOR FILE Y.
       C    = REAL ADDITIVE CONSTANT.
       NAME = NEW NAME TO BE GIVEN TO THE OUTPUT RECORDS.
       NPG  = (OPTIONAL) OUTPUT PACKING DENSITY
 
       NOTE: IF **ALL OF** A, B AND C ARE LEFT BLANK (AND NOT 0), 
             THEY ARE THEN SET TO +1.0,+1.0 AND 0.0, RESPECTIVELY.

      NOTE THAT MISSING VALUE TREATMENT IS SUPPORTED VIA EITHER
      THE "MISSING_VALUE" ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE OR THE "-mvalue"
      COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT. PLEASE SEE THE R.DIAG WEB
      DOCUMENTAION FOR MORE DETAILS.
