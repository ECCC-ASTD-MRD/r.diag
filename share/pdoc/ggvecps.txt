      PURPOSE - 1) GGVECPS IS MEANT TO TRANSFORM WIND VECTORS FROM
                LAT-LONG GRIDS TO POLAR STEREOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION
                AND 2) GGVECZ DOES THE SAME THING FOR THE CMC/RPN
                GEM FORECAST MODEL NATIVE Z-TYPE GRIDS.
 
      NOTES  1) THE GGVECPS TRANSFORMATION MATRIX INVOLVES A LINEAR
                COMBINATION OF SINES AND COSINES OF LONGITUDE.
             2) THE GGVECPS INPUT GRID TYPE IS ALWAYS ASSUMED
                TO BE GAUSSIAN WHEN DEALING WITH CCCma FILES.
             3) FOR RPN/CMC STANDARD FILES, THE GGVECPS INPUT GRID
                TYPES CAN BE G (GAUSSIAN), A (LAT-LONG), B (LAT-LONG
                WITH POLES AND EQUATOR) AND L (GENERALIZED LAT-LONG).
             4) THE INPUT/OUTPUT GRIDS FOR GGVECZ ARE ALWAYS TYPE Z.
             5) MISSING VALUE TREATMENT IS SUPPORTED VIA EITHER THE
               "MISSING_VALUE" ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE OR THE "-mvalue"
                COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT. PLEASE SEE THE R.DIAG WEB
                DOCUMENTAION FOR MORE DETAILS.
