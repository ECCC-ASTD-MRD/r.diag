* src/cdr2ccc

From looking in =${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/bin=, we see =cdf2ccc= and =cdf2rpn= which call executables compiled in the directory.

Right now it's just the library that is compiled and the executables are not

The makefile has

#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
cdf2ccc: initial cdf2ccc.F90
    s.f90 -src cdf2ccc2.F90 -o $@ $$(s.prefix -L $(LIBPATH)) $$(s.prefix -I "$(INCLUDES) $(MODDIR)") $$(s.prefix -l $(MALIB) $(lNetCDF) $(UDUNITS) $(DIAGLIB) $(VGDLIB) $(RMNLIB) \
	if [ -x $@ ] ; then \
		/bin/ln -f $@_$(CONV_VERSION)_$(COMP_ARCH) cdf2rpn_$(CONV_VERSION)_$(COMP_ARCH) ; \
	fi
#+END_SRC

so it's =ln -f cdf2ccc_${stuff} cdf2rpn_${stuff}=

Ask someone if there is anything special (aside from the obvious possibility that the code looks at argv[0]) with this so that I reproduce the result well.
