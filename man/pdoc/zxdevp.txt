      PURPOSE - COMPUTES DEVIATIONS FROM THE VERTICAL PRESSURE MEAN FOR A FIL
                OF CROSS-SECTIONS.
 
      NOTE    - 1) MAX LATITUDES IS 999, MAX LEVELS IS 999 
                2) AT INPUT THE CROSS-SECTION IS ORDERED FROM S TO N 
                   AND TOP TO BOTTOM
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       ZXIN  = CROSS-SECTIONS
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       ZXOUT = DEVIATION CROSS-SECTIONS
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 PROBLEMS READING ZXIN
        2 FOUND DATA TYPE NOT ZONAL
        3 ABORT ERROR READING ZXIN
        4 ZXIN NOT ON PRESSURE LEVELS
