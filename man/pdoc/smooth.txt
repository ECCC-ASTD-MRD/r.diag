      DESCRIPTION...
       THIS PROGRAM WILL  CALCULATE A CERTAIN  KIND OF AREA AVERAGE OF 
       GIN SO THAT GOUT(I,J) CONTAINS THE SUM OF IT'S ADJACENT POINTS. 
       MORE PRECISELY THE OUTPUT IS : 
 
                       ( GIN(I-1,J-1)              + GIN(I-1,J+1) ) * GEOM
                                      + GIN(I-1,J)
         GOUT(I,J) = +   GIN(I  ,J-1) + GIN(I  ,J) + GIN(I  ,J+1) 
                                      + GIN(I+1,J)
                     + ( GIN(I+1,J-1)              + GIN(I+1,J+1) ) * GEOM
 
      NOTES: 1) GIN HAS TO BE A 'GRID' OR 'SUBA' FILE.
             2) CYCLICAL SYMMETRY IS ASSUMED ONLY IN THE X DIRECTION
                AND ONLY FOR 'GRID' FILES.
             3) WHEN THE "-def" COMMAND-LINE PARAMETER IS SPECIFIED,
                GOUT WILL CONTAIN THE AVERAGE RATHER THAN THE SUM OF
                THE ADJACENT POINTS.
             4) BY DEFAULT, THE GEOM PARAMETRE IS EQUAL TO ZERO. A VALUE
                OF -1 WILL ALSO RESULT IN ZERO. SPECIFYING ANYTHING ELSE
                WILL SET ITS VALUE TO ONE.
