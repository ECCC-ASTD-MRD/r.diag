      PURPOSE - APPENDS SUPERLABELLED SETS IN FILE 'ADD' TO FILE 'OLD'. 
 
 
      INPUT FILES... 
 
       OLD = FILE OF SUPERLABELED SETS (CAN BE EMPTY) 
       ADD = FILE CONTAINING THE NEW SUPERLABELLED SET(S) TO BE APPENDED 
 
      OUTPUT FILE... 
 
       NEW = COPY OF OLD WITH NEW SUPERLABELLED SET(S) APPENDED.
 
 
       NOTES: 1) FILE 'OLD' AND 'ADD' CONTAIN NO IDENTICAL SUPERLABELS,
                 OR ONE OR BOTH OF THEM CONTAIN NO SUPERLABELS.
 
                 THE RESULT 'NEW' IS THE COMBINATION OF 'OLD'
                 AND APPENDED 'ADD'.
 
              2) FILE 'OLD' CONTAINS SUPERLABELLED SETS A, B, AND
                 FILE 'ADD' CONTAINS SUPERLABELLED SETS A, B, AND C.
 
                 THE RESULT 'NEW' IS IDENTICAL TO 'ADD'.
 
              3) FILE 'OLD' CONTAINS SUPERLABELLED SETS A, B, AND C.
                 FILE 'ADD' CONTAINS SUPERLABELLED SETS A, B.
 
                 THE RESULT 'NEW' CONTAINS C FROM 'OLD'
                 FOLLOWED BY A,B FROM 'ADD'.
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 TOO MANY SETS IN ADD
        2 CANNOT CHANGE/MIX PACKING TYPE
        3 NO RECORD SAVED FROM ADD
