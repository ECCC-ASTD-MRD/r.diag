      DESCRIPTION...
       A PROGRAM WHICH...
 
       ... SORTS THE TIMESETS IN FILE DATA ACCORDING TO THE VALUES
           FOUND IN THE FIRST RECORD OF FILE CRITERIA.
 
       NOTES: 1) THERE SHOULD BE AT MANY TIMESETS IN FILE DATA AS THERE
                 ARE POINTS IN THE RECORD READ FROM FILE CRITERIA
              2) WHEN KIND >= 0, THE PROGRAM WILL ALWAYS TRY TO ALLOCATE
                 ENOUGH MEMORY TO FIT THE FULL FILE DATA.
              3) THE TIMESETS CAN CONTAIN MULTIPLE LEVELS AND/OR MULTIPLE
                 VARIABLES. IN THIS LAST CASE, THE FILE IS SUPPOSED TO BE
                 SORTED ACCORDING TO A TIMESTEP/NAME/LEVEL RULE,
                 FROM MOST TO LEAST SIGNIFICANT
            
 
      INPUT PARAMETER...
       ABS(KIND) =  0,1, TO SORT IN INCREASING ORDER (DEFAULT)
                    2,   TO SORT IN DECREASING ORDER
           KIND  <  0,   TO TREAT TIMESERIES RECORDS INDIVIDUALLY
                 >= 0,   TO TREAT THE WHOLE FILES AS THE TIMESERIES
