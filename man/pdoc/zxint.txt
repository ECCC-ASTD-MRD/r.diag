      DESCRIPTION...
       zxint  - GRAPHS LATITUDE AVG AND PRESSURE INTEGRAL OF A  CROSS-SECTION
 
 
      AUTHOR  - J.D.Henderson, NOV 29/83.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/zxint.ptn,v 4.9 2014/09/25 20:20:57 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE - GRAPHS ONE CROSS-SECTION (FROM FILE ZXIN) WHICH IS AVERAGED
                IN LATITUDE AND INTEGRATED IN PRESSURE. THE VALUE OF THE
                GLOBAL INTEGRAL PER UNIT AREA IS ALSO PRINTED.
      NOTES   - 1) AT INPUT THE CROSS-SECTION IS ORDERED FROM S TO N AND
                   TOP TO BOTTOM.
                2) THE MAXIMUM LATITUDES AND LEVELS ARE SET TO 999.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       ZXIN = FILE CONTAINING ONE CROSS-SECTION.
 
 
      INPUT PARAMETERS...
 
       CONST     (scal) = MULTIPLICATIVE CONSTANT (DEFAULTS TO 1./9.80616)
       GMIN,GMAX (a,b)  = MIN AND MAX LIMITS FOR THE GRAPH OF PRESSURE
                          INTEGRAL VS. LATITUDE. IF BOTH ARE ZERO THE
                          LIMITS ARE CALCULATED.
       LABEL            = 80 CHARACTER LABEL PRINTED ON THE GRAPH.
