       repack - REPACKS A FILE 
  
 
      AUTHOR  - J.D.Henderson AND R.Laprise, MAY 13/83.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/repack.ptn,v 4.18 2014/12/04 00:25:58 dugas Exp $
  
 
      PURPOSE - REPACKS A COMPLETE FILE WITH A NEW PACKING DENSITY. 
  
 
      INPUT FILE... 
       XIN  = FILE TO BE REPACKED. 
  
      OUTPUT FILE... 
       XOUT = COPY OF FILE XIN PACKED WITH NEW PACKING DENSITY. 
  
 
      INPUT PARAMETERS... 
  
       NEWPAK  = NEW PACKING DENSITY FOR THE FILE. POSITIVE NUMBERS
       (npg)     STAND FOR THE PACKING DENSITY WITH RESPECT TO HOST
                 WORDS (i.e. NEWPAK DATUMS PER WORD). NEGATIVE VAL-
                 UES STAND FOR THE NUMBER OF BITS TO USE IN PACKING
                 EACH DATUM (i.e. -newpak BITS ARE THEN USED).
 
       KIND(1) = This paramatre is only relevant when 1) NEWPAK=-16
                 or -32 and 2) with RPN/CMC files. Then, its possible
                 values are 'STD' and 'TURBO'. The later forces the
                 use of Yves Chartier's Turbo Compression Algorithms
                 as implemented in 2006, while the former can be used
                 to remove the TURBO compression. Not specifying it
                 preserves the compression type.
 
       KIND(2) = When KIND(1) = 'TURBO', specifies the type of
                 compression to be used. The possible values are...
                 'ENV' (use the FST_OPTIONS="TURBOCOMP=????" variable);
                 'BEST' (as the name implies);
                 'FAST' (again, as the name implies).
 
                 The primary default behaviour is to get this from the
                 environment. It this fails, the secondary default is
                 set to 'BEST' mode.
