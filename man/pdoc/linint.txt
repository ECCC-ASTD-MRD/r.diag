      DESCRIPTION...
       THIS PROGRAM WILL LINEARLY INTERPOLATE BETWEEN TWO SPECIFIC 
       TIME INTERVAL, REPLACING ANYTHING FOUND BETWEEN THEM. AS MANY
       AS 10000 SUCH INTERVALS CAN BE TREATED. THE TIMESTEPS SHOULD
       BE IN ORDER, AS NO REWIND IS DONE BETWEEN SETS OF INTERVALS.
       FINALLY, XIN SHOULD NOT CONTAIN MORE THAN A SINGLE VARIABLE.
 
 
      INPUT PARAMETER...
 
       T1 (t1) = START OF INTERPOLATING INTERVAL
       T2 (t2) = END OF INTERPOLATING INTERVAL
       DT (t3) = NUMBER OF TIMESTEPS TO BE INSERTED
       KIND    = FLAG TO INDICATE METHOD OF TIME MEASUREMENT.
               = 0 ==> IBUF(2),T1,T2 AND T3 IN KOUNT UNITS.
               = 1 ==> IBUF(2),T1 AND T2 ARE IN THE FORMAT YYYYMMDDHH
                       AND T3 IS IN HOURS.
               = 2 ==> IBUF(2),T1 AND T2 ARE IN THE FORMAT YYYYMMDDHHMM
                       AND T3 IS IN MINUTES AND NO LEAP YEAR.
               = 3 ==> IBUF(2),T1 AND T2 ARE IN THE FORMAT YYYYMMDDHH
                       AND T3 IS IN HOURS. BUT NOW, LEAP YEARS ARE
                       ACCOUNTED FOR.
 
       NOTES: 1) KIND = 0,1 OR 2 DO NOT TAKE LEAP YEARS INTO ACCOUNT
                 AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE WITH MODEL OUTPUT.
              2) KIND CAN ONLY BE SPECIFIED ON THE FIRST INPUT CARD.
