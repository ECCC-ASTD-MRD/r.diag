      DESCRIPTION...
       smspec - SPECTRAL FILTERING USING DISCREET SIN AND COS TRANSFORMS.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       IN     = INPUT ARRAY FILE
 
      OUTPUT FILES...
       OUT    = FILTERED ARRAY FILE
       FILTER = THE ACTUAL FILTER ARRAY (OPTIONAL)
 
 
      PARAMETERS...
       CAS (a) = TYPE OF (SUPPORTED) TRANSFORMS.
                 3 => SIN SHIFTED ONLY.
                 4 => COS SHIFTED ONLY.
                 5 => REGULAR SIN & COS (DEFAULT)
       WXL (b) = LONG WAVELENGTH CUTOFF (DEFAULT=1.E-20)
                 INFORMATION WITH WAVELENGTH LONGER OR EQUAL TO WXL WILL
                 BE PRESERVE.
       WXS (c) = SHORT WAVELENGTH CUTOFF (DEFAULT=1.E-20)
                 INFORMATION WITH WAVELENGTH SMALLER OR EQUAL THAN WXL WILL
                 BE REMOVED.
       DX  (d) = GRID SPACING IN KILOMETERS (DEFAULT=1)
 
 
       Notes: 1) If WXL = WXS, then wavelength smaller (not equal) than WXL
                 will be removed. WXL must always be .GE. than WXS.
              2) The filter function is equal to "1" at WXL and to "0" at WXS.
                 In between it follows a "COS(WAVENUMBER)**2" function.
              3) As of now, grids have to be of even-sized dimensions.
