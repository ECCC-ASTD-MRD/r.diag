       psdiv  - DIVIDES A FILE OF GRIDS BY A CORRESPONDING ONE-LEVEL FILE

      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/psdiv.ptn,v 4.9 2014/09/25 20:20:52 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE - DIVIDES A FILE OF REAL OR COMPLEX MULTI-LEVEL GRIDS
                SETS (IN2) BY A FILE OF CORRESPONDING ONE LEVEL FIELDS
                (IN1). EACH ONE LEVEL FIELD DIVIDES AN ENTIRE SET FROM
                THE MULTI-LEVEL FILE.
 
      NOTES   - 1) BOTH INPUT FILES IN1 AND IN2 MUST HAVE REAL OR
                   COMPLEX GRID  DATA (I.E. ZONL,GRID,SUBA OR CMPL)
                2) THERE MUST BE ONE SET IN IN2 FOR EACH FIELD IN IN1
                3) IF IN1 IS MULTI-LEVEL, ITS FIRST LEVEL IS USED
                4) DIVISION BY ZERO YIELDS ZERO
 
 
      INPUT FILES...
       IN1 = FILE OF MULTI- OR SINGLE-LEVEL FIELDS.
       IN2 = FILE OF MULTI-LEVEL SETS.
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       OUT = THE QUOTIENT
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 FIRST RECORDS NOT SAME SIZE IN IN1,IN2
        2 FOUND UNSUPPORTED DATA TYPE
        3 RECORDS NOT THE SAME SIZE IN IN1
        4 FEWER SETS FILE IN2 THAN IN FILE IN1
        5 RECORDS NOT THE SAME SIZE IN IN2
        6 UNABLE TO READ IN1
        7 UNABLE TO READ IN2
