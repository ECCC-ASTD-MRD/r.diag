      PURPOSE - CONVERTS SPECTRAL GEOPOTENTIALS (PHI) ON MODEL FULL
                LEVELS TO SPECTRAL TEMPERATURES ON MODEL HALF LEVELS.
                EACH SET CONTAINS SIGMA LEVELS 1 TO ILEV.
 
 
      INPUT FILES...
       SSPHIS = INPUT FILE OF SPECTRAL MOUNTAIN FIELDS.
       SSPHI  = INPUT FILE OF SPECTRAL GEOPOTENTIALS (PHI) ON FULL
                              SIGMA LEVELS.
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       SSTEMP = OUTPUT FILE OF SPECTRAL TEMPERATURES ON HALF LEVELS.
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 NOT ENOUGH OR TOO MANY LEVELS IN SSPHI
        2 UNABLE TO READ SSPHIS
        3 PHI AND PHIS NOT THE SAME SIZE
        4 UNABLE TO READ SSPHI
        5 UNABLE TO OPERATE ON FILE SSPHI
        6 WRONG VERTICAL COORDINATE
