      PURPOSE - ADDS ONE SUPERLABELLED SET TO FILE OLD AND COPIES 
                THE RESULT TO FILE NEW.
 
 
      INPUT FILES... 
 
       OLD = FILE OF SUPERLABELED SETS (CAN BE EMPTY) 
       ADD = FILE CONTAINING THE NEW SET TO BE ADDED OR REPLACED 
 
      OUTPUT FILE... 
 
       NEW = COPY OF OLD WITH NEW SET ADDED OR REPLACED. 
 
 
      INPUT PARAMETER... 
 
       SPRLBL = 256 CHARACTER SUPERLABEL FOR NEW SET TO BE ADDED/DELETED. 
       TO DELETE A SET: "..DELETE" MUST FIRST BE SPECIFIED IN COLUMNS
                        11 TO 18 FOLLOWED BY THE SUPERLABEL, (SUBJECT
                        TO THE RESTICTIONS SPECIFIED BELOW), ON THE
                        SECOND CARD. AN "EOR" MARK CARD MUST FOLLOW
                        THE "..DELETE" AND SUPERLABEL CARDS. 
       TO  ADD   A SET: THE SUPERLABEL MUST BE READ FROM COLUMN 11
                        TO 266 AND  IT MUST NOT START WITH "0" OR
                         "1". IF IT STARTS WITH A SPACE, THE NEXT 
                        THREE CHARACTERS MUST ALSO BE SPACES.  AS
                        WELL, A VALID SUPERLABEL CONTAINS AT LEAST 
                        ONE NON-BLANK CHARACTER. 
 
       NOTES: 1) IF "label" IS SPECIFIED AT CALL TIME, IT'S VALUE IS PASSED TO 
                 SPRLBL, AND THE DELETE MODE OF OPERATION IS THEN UNAVAILABLE.
              2) LEADING BLANKS ARE IGNORED IN SPRLBL WHEN XSAVE IS USED
                 WITH STANDARD SEQUENTIAL FILES.
              3) IF THE "def" PARAMETER IS SPECIFIED, XSAVE WILL ONLY TRY
                 TO MATCH THE SPECIFED LABEL WITH THOSE ON FILE OLD UP TO
                 THE LENGTH OF THE NEW LABEL. TRAILING BLANKS ARE IGNORED.
                 THIS BEHAVIOR CAN BE USEFULL WHEN REPLACING A VERY LONG
                 LABELED SET OF RECORDS. OTHERWISE, AN EXACT MATCH IS
                 REQUIRED.
