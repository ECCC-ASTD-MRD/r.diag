      AUTHOR   - M.Lazare, JUN 22/84.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/lpprint.ptn,v 4.18 2014/09/25 20:20:50 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE  - PRINTS VALUES FROM INLP FILE, ONE RECORD AT A TIME.
                 THE PRINTOUT IS CLASSIFIED BY LATITUDE (AND POSSIBLY
                 LONGITUDE), FOR EASY READING.
 
      NOTES    - 1) THE PROGRAM DOES NOT CHECK FOR NAME, LEVEL OR
                    TIMESTEP NUMBER.
                 2) THE MAXIMUM SIZE ALLOWABLE CORRESPONDS TO GRID OF
                    1X1 DEGREE RESOLUTION.
                 3) THE PROGRAM WILL NOT ABORT; IT WILL TERMINATE WITH A
                    MESSAGE IF:
                    a) - THERE IS A PROBLEM IN OBTAINING THE RECORD.
                    b) - AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO OPERATE ON A SPECTRAL FILE.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       INLP = LAT-LONG, GAUSSIAN GRID, ZONAL FIELDS WITH EQUALLY-SPACED
              LATITUDES, OR ZONAL FIELDS WITH GAUSSIAN LATITUDES FILE
              OR FOURIER COEFFICIENTS OR STRAIGHT DATA RECORDS.
              RPN L- AND Z-TYPE ARRAYS ARE ALSO SUPPORTED.
 
 
      INPUT PARAMETERS...
 
       NTYP   = DETERMINES THE TYPE OF ARRAYS FOUND IN CCCma FILES:

                2 OR 'B' STANDS FOR RPN/CMC B-TYPE GRIDS
       SCALE  = REAL NUMBER BY WHICH THE VALUES ARE TO BE MULTIPLIED BEFORE
       (a)      BEING PRINTED IN A F9.2 FORMAT (DEFAULTS TO AUTOSCALE)
       LABEL  = 80 CHARACTER LABEL PRINTED BELOW LISTING OF DATA
