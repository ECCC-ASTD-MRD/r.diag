      DESCRIPTION...
       vsint  - VERTICAL SIGMA INTEGRAL OF A FILE (FULL OR HALF LEVELS)
 
      AUTHOR  - B.Dugas, FEB 25/85.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/vsint.ptn,v 4.12 2014/09/25 20:20:56 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE - VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF A FILE OF SETS ON SIGMA LEVELS
      NOTES   - 1) MINIMUM NUMBER OF LEVELS IS 3, MAX IS 999. THEY SHOULD
                   ALSO BE MONOTONICALLY INCREASING.
                2) WHEN THE -def KEY IS SPECIFIED, THE DOMAIN TOP AND BOTTOM
                   ARE GIVEN BY THE FIRST AN LAST DATA LEVEL, RESPECTIVELY.
                   OTHERWISE, VSINT WILL USE 0.0 AND 1.0.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       XIN  = FILE OF SIGMA LEVEL SETS ON EITHER FULL OR HALF LEVELS.
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       XOUT = OUTPUT SERIES OF SIGMA VERTICAL INTEGRALS OF XIN.
 
 
      INPUT PARAMETERS...
 
       SIGTYP (kind) = TYPE OF SIGMA LEVELS. 'FULL' FOR FULL LEVELS,
                       'HALF' FOR HALF LEVELS. DEFAULT IS 'FULL'.
       CONST  (a)    = MULTIPLICATIVE CONSTANT FOR THE INTEGRALS.
                       BLANK INPUT DEFAULTS TO 1.0.

      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 PREMATURE EOF ON XIN
        2 NOT ENOUGH OR TOO MANY LEVELS IN FIRST SET OF XIN
        3 MORE THAN ONE SIZE FOR ARRAYS IN XIN
        4 NOT ENOUGH LEVELS IN LAST SET READ
        5 ERROR READING INPUT PARAMETERS
        6 LEVELS ARE NOT INCREASING MONOTONICALLY
        7 XIN DOES NOT CONTAIN SIGMA LEVELS
