      PURPOSE...
       THIS PROGRAM WILL EITHER : 
  
       1) EXTRACT WINDOWS OF GRID FILE GIN  AND PUT THEM IN FILE
          GOUT. I1, I2 AND J1, J2 ARE THE LEFT, RIGHT AND LOWER,
          UPPER GRID INDICES OF THE WINDOW. 
  
                           ****  OR  ****
  
       2) EXPAND A  PRE-EXISTING WINDOW. POINTS OUTSIDE IT  ARE SET
          TO A INPUT  DETERMINED VALUE.  (I1, J1) IS THE LEFT LOWER
          CORNER THE WINDOW WILL OCCUPY IN GOUT AND (I2, J2) IS THE
          ROW AND COLUMN DIMENSIONS OF GOUT.
 
       NOTES: 1) IN BOTH CASES, THE SMALLER WINDOW MAY CROSS THE BORDER
                 OF THE LARGER (i.e. "I2 < I1" IN CASE(1)), AS LONG AS
                 WE DO NOT KNOW THAT THE LARGER IS NON-GLOBAL.
              2) PARAMETERS I1 AND I2 ARE IGNORED FOR ZONAL ARRAYS.
              3) FOR COMPLEX GRIDS, I1 AND I2 CORRESPOND TO COMPLEX NUMBERS.
              4) APPROPRIATE GRID DESCRIPTORS FOR RPN STANDARD FILES ARE
                 WRITTEN. THIS MEANS THAT A GENERAL COMPRESSED SUB-GRID
                 MAY BE CONVERTED TO A 'Z' TYPE ARRAY. IN THIS CASE, THE
                 ORIGINAL DESCRIPTORS WILL BE RESTORED AT EXPANSION.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       GIN  = ANY FILE OF (REAL OR COMPLEX) GRIDS, SUBAREAS OR ZONAL ARRAYS
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       GOUT = RESULTING FILE OF RESIZED ARRAYS
 
 
      INPUT PARAMETER...
 
       I1,   J1        AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. BOTH DEFAULT TO 1.
      (dlon1,dlat1)    
       I2,   J2        AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DEFAULT TO WORD 5 AND 6
      (dlon2,dlat2)    OF THE FIRST VALID DATA INFO BUFFER OF FILE GIN.
                       THIS CORRESPONDS TO NI,NJ IN RPN STANDARD FILES.

                       OTHERWISE, EXPANDING WINDOW CASE
       VALUE (a)     = REAL NUMBER TO BE USED AS FILLING IN THE EXPANDING
                       WINDOW CASE.
       IHEM  (nhem)  = FORCE IHEM (HEMISPHERE ID) IN ALL OUTPUT GRID.
       NPG           = (OPTIONAL ON COMMAND-LINE) OUTPUT PACKING DENSITY
