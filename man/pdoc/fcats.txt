      PURPOSE -  COMPUTE ACTUAL TIME SERIES FROM TIME SERIES FOURIER 
                 COEFFICIENTS. 
      NOTE    -  IF INPUT TYPE OF FCOEFS IS 'SPEC' THE DATA PACKING HAS
                 TO BE OFF OR THE FIRST LM IMAGINARY COMPONENTS WILL BE
                 LOST. IN THIS CASE THE PROGRAM WILL PRINT A WARNING.. 
  
 
      INPUT FILE... 
       FCOEFS = A FILE OF TIME SERIES FOURIER COEFFICIENTS. 
  
      OUTPUT FILE...  
       TSER   = THE FINITE FOURIER TRANSFORMS OF FILE FCOEFS WITH ITS 
                RECORDS HAVING THE FOLLOWING LABEL: 
  
         IBUF(1) =  'GRID', 'CMPL', 'ZONL' OR 'COEF' DEPENDING ON THE INPUT
                    VALUE OF IBUF(1). IF THE INPUT VALUE OF IBUF(1) IS 'SPEC',
                    THE OUTPUT VALUE IS TO BE 'COEF'. IF THIS INPUT VALUE IS
                    'FOUR', THE OUTPUT VALUE WILL BE EITHER 'ZONL' OR 'GRID',
                    DEPENDING ON THE VALUE OF IBUF(7) = CCCRRRK.
         IBUF(2) =  IF KIND = 'ZONL', 'CMPL' OR 'GRID' THEN IT IS THE ORDINAL
                    OF THE LOCATION OF THE POINT IN THE ORIGINAL LATLON GRID.
                    IF KIND = 'COEF' THEN IT IS THE ORDINAL OF THE LOCATION
                    OF THE COEFFICIENT IN THE REAL LA*2 LENGTH VECTOR 
         IBUF(3) =  NAME . 
         IBUF(4) =  LEVEL . 
         IBUF(5) =  FOR ALL EXCEPT 'CMPL', 2*(LENGTH-1) WHERE LENGTH IS THE
                    LENGTH OF THE FOURIER COEFFICIENTS SERIES. THE LONGEST
                    TIME SERIES THAT BE PROCESSED IS 200000 POINTS LONG.
                 =  FOR THE COMPLEX 'CMPL', LENGTH ITSELF.
         IBUF(6) =  1 
         IBUF(7) =  DIMENSIONS OF ARRAY KHEM (IN FORMAT CCCRRRK, WHERE CCC IS 
                    THE NUMBER OF LONGITUDES AND RRR IS THE NUMBER OF LATITUDES,
                    OR  LRLMT)
         IBUF(8) =  PACKING DENSITY 
  
 
      INPUT PARAMETERS... 
  
         LENGTH = THE ACTUAL  LENGTH USED IN  THE  TRANSFORM. THIS NUMBER
         (lon)    SHOULD  BE EVEN.  IF IT IS'NT  THE PROGRAM WILL DISCARD
                  ONE POINT. THE REST (IF ANY) OF THE SERIES IS DICARDED.
                  IF THE INPUT VALUE OF LENGTH IS ZERO, THE PROGRAM WILL 
                  THE ACTUAL LENGTH OF THE FIRST INPUT SERIES TO DETERMI 
                  WHICH OF THE TWO PRECEEDING CASES HOLD.
