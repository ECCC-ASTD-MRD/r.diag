      DESCRIPTION...
       crvplot - PLOT CURVES IN THE X - Y PLANE
 
 
      AUTHORS - F.Zwiers, R.Laprise, 1985.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/crvplot.ptn,v 4.21 2014/12/22 19:24:53 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE - READ GROUPS OF MULTI-VALUED FUNCTIONS FROM FILE YAXIS AND
                PLOTS THEM AGAINST FUNCTION FROM FILE XAXIS (IF PRESENT).
 
        NOTES - 1) YAXIS AND XAXIS MUST HAVE PROPER CCC 8-WORD LABEL
                  (MEANING THAT IT IS EITHER A ZONAL OR A TIME SERIES ARRAY).
                2) SPECIFYING "-def" ON THE COMMAND LINE ACTIVATES A MODE
                   IN WHICH THE PROGRAM WILL PLOT ALL RECORDS IN YAXIS.
                3) THE DEFAULT IS TO REWIND FILE(S) YAXIS (AND XAXIS)
                   BETWEEN EACH SET OF INPUT CARDS. HOWEVER, NOTE THAT
                   ONLY ONE SET OF DIRECTIVES CAN BE DEFINED WHEN THE
                   PROGRAM IS IN IN COMMAND-LINE MODE.
                4) CRVPLOT CAN ONLY HANDLE REAL DATA.
 
 
      INPUT FILES...
       YAXIS = FUNCTIONS TO BE PLOTTED ON YAXIS
       XAXIS = FUNCTIONS TO BE PLOTTED ON XAXIS (OPTIONNAL)
 
 
      CARDS READ...
 
       ==================================================
       UP TO FOUR INPUT CARDS ARE READ. EACH SET OF INPUT
       CARDS DEFINES THE NUMBER OF CURVES ON THAT PLOT.
