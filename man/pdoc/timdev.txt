      PURPOSE - COMPUTES THE 2-D TIME DEVIATION  FROM THE TIME AVERAGE FOR EACH 
                LEVEL OF A SERIES OF (MULTI-LEVEL) SETS OF DATA HAVING THE SAME
                SIZE AND TYPE. MAXIMUM LEVELS IS 999.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       SERA = SERIES OF  MULTI-VARIABLE MULTI-LEVEL SETS, 
              WHERE THE DATA MAY BE REAL OR COMPLEX.
       AVGA = CONTAINS ONE SET WHICH IS THE MEAN OF ALL
              THE SETS IN FILE SERA.
       NOTES: 1) THE INPUT FILES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE,
                 I.E. THE SAME VERTICAL LEVELS AND VARIABLES.
              2) THESE FILES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SORTED ACCORDING
                 TO A TIMESTEP/NAME/LEVEL RULE, FROM MOST TO
                 LEAST SIGNIFICANT
              
      OUTPUT FILE...
       DEVA = DEVIATIONS FROM THE MEAN 
 
 
      Command-line arguments...
       mvalue = Real number used to identify missing values (DEF = none)
 
      Missing value mode...
       Missing value treatment is activated by providing a real number to be
       used as a missing value flag with the "-mvalue" command-line argument.
       Data that has this value will be disregarded by the program.
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 PROBLEMS READING INPUT FILES
        2 AVGA AND SERA RECORDS NOT THE SAME SIZE
        3 PREMATURE EOF ON FILE AVGA
        4 PREMATURE EOF ON FILE SERA
        5 UNABLE TO ALLOCATE ENOUGH WORKING MEMORY
        6 BAD ARGUMENT VALUE WITH A COMMAND-LINE PARAMETRE
