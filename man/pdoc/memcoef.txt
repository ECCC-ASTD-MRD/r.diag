      PURPOSE - READS A TIME-SERIES AND CALCULATES THE COEFFICIENTS OF 
                THE MAXIMUM ENTROPY METHOD OR ITS POWER SPECTRUM.

      PARAMETERS...
 
      ORDER (a)    =   ORDER OF THE MODEL (defaults to the length-1 of SERI).
      KIND  (kind) = 0 INPUT IS A TIME SERIES. OUTPUT ARE THE MEM COEFFICIENTS.
                   > 0 INPUT ARE THE MEM COEFFICIENTS. OUTPUT IS THE POWER 
                       SPECTRUM BETWEEN THE NYQUIST FREQUENCY AND 0. KIND
                       IS THEN THE NF NUMBER OF REQUESTED FREQUENCIES.
