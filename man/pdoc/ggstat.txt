      DESCRIPTION...
       ggstat - PRINTS STATISTICS FOR EACH FIELD IN A SET OF GRID/SPEC FILE
 
 
      AUTHOR  - J.D.Henderson, MAY 11/83.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/ggstat.ptn,v 4.25 2014/09/25 20:20:49 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE - PRINTS SIMPLE STATISTICS FOR EACH FIELD IN A SET OF FILES.
                IF THE DATA IS REAL,  THE PROGRAM PRINTS THE MIN, MAX, MEAN
                AND VARIANCE OF THE FIELDS.
 
                IF THE DATA IS COMPLEX (i.e. TYPE 'CMPL'), THE MAXIMUM AND
                MINIMUM AMPLITUDES, AS WELL AS THE MEAN AND VARIANCES
                ARE PRINTED.
 
      NOTES   - 1) AS ONE LINE IS PRINTED FOR EACH RECORD IN THE FILES,
                   THIS MAY RESULT IN A LARGE OUTPUT.
                2) KIND IS ZERO BY DEFAULT (I.E. ORIGINAL MODE)
                3) AN OLD GG2 FILE WILL NEVER BE OVERWRITTEN.
                4) MISSING VALUE TREATMENT IS SUPPORTED VIA EITHER
                   THE "MISSING_VALUE" ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE OR THE
                   "-mvalue" COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT. PLEASE SEE THE
                   R.DIAG WEB DOCUMENTAION FOR MORE DETAILS.
 
 
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       GG01         = FIRST INPUT FILE (REAL OR COMPLEX)
       GG02 TO GG79 = OTHER INPUT FILES (REAL OR COMPLEX), BUT ONLY WHEN KIND=0
 
     (OPTIONAL AND NEW) OUTPUT FILE...
       GG02         = SIMPLE ARITHMETIC MEAN     (WHEN KIND=1)
                    = SIMPLE ARITHMETIC VARIANCE (WHEN KIND=2)
                    = MAXIMUM VALUE/AMPLITUDE    (WHEN KIND=3)
                    = MINIMUM VALUE/AMPLITUDE    (WHEN KIND=4)
