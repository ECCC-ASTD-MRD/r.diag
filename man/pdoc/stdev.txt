      PURPOSE...
       TIMCOV - COMPUTES THE 2-D TIME COVARIANCES FOR EACH VARIABLE AND
                LEVEL OF A SERIES OF SETS OF DATA.
       STDEV  - CALCULATES AT EACH LEVEL, THE 2-D STANDARD DEVIATION OF
                ONE MULTI-LEVEL TIME SERIE DATA SETS OF DEVIATIONS FROM
                THE TIME MEAN
 
 
      INPUT FILES...
      (FOR TIMCOV)
       SERA    = FIRST TIME SERIES OF MULT-VARIABLE MULTI-LEVEL SETS.
       SERB    = SECOND TIME SERIES OF MULT-VARIABLE MULTI-LEVEL SETS.
      (FOR STDEV)
       FILEDEV = TIME SERIES OF MULT-VARIABLE MULTI-LEVEL DEVIATIONS SETS
 
       THESE FILES ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE SORTED ACCORDING TO A
       TIMESTEP/NAME/LEVEL RULE, FROM MOST TO LEAST SIGNIFICANT
              
      OUTPUT FILE...
      (FOR TIMCOV)
       COV     = THE TIME COVARIANCE OF THE TWO OTHER (INPUT) FILES.
      (FOR STDEV)
       STDDEVI = GRID SET OF THE STANDARD DEVIATION.
 
 
      Command-line arguments...
       def    = [STDEV ONLY] Remove mean from FILEDEV (see note 1)
       kind   = [STDEV ONLY] 'STD' ==> Output standard deviations (Default)
                [STDEV ONLY] 'VAR' ==> Output variances rather than std devs
       mvalue = Real number used to identify missing values (DEF = none)
       name   = [TIMCOV only] Alternate output name when SERA and SERB differ
       npg    = Output packing density (DEF = -32)
 
      Missing value mode...
       Missing value treatment is activated by providing a real number to be
       used as a missing value flag with the "-mvalue" command-line argument.
       Data that has this value will be disregarded by the program.
 
 
      Notes: 1) The input file(s) may or may not already contain deviations
                from the time mean(s). The time means will removed from the
                file(s) when the "-def" command-line key is specified (i.e.
                TIMDEV need not be called previous to TIMCOV or STDEV)
             2) Only the first full homogeneous sets are treated.
             3) By default, when SERA and SERB contain different
                variables, the output variable name is set to "COV".
                This behavior can be overwritten by using the "-name"
                command-line parametre to specify an altername name.
             4) The data may be REAL or COMPLEX. For COMPLEX fields,
                the programs will perform either of the following operation
                >> TIMAVG( SERA * COMPLEX CONJUGATE( SERB ) ) <<  *** OR ***
                >> SQRT( TIMAVG( FILEDEV * COMPLEX CONJUGATE( FILEDEV ) ) ) <<
             5) Specifying the "-npg" command-line parametre with a valid
                value forces TIMCOV/STDEV to use this packing density.
             6) When dealing with RPN Standard files, TIMCOV and STDEV
                modify the file's time descriptors such that the earliest
                sample time sample time is saved in DATEO, while the latest
                can be reconstructed from new values of DATEO, NPAS and DEET.
                In addition, IP3 will then contain the number of time samples
                used to construct the average. Other R.DIAG modules such as
                TIMGEN and the statistical testing modules (FTEST, ...)
                can then use this information directly.
