      PURPOSE - COMPUTES AN ESTIMATE OF POPULATION STANDARD
                DEVIATION FROM THE MEAN SQUARED DEVIATION.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       VBIAS  = FILE OF GRIDS OR ZONAL PROFILES OF BIASED ESTIMATES OF
                VARIANCE ( SUMS OF SQUARED DEVIATIONS DIVIDED BY N ).
                IT IS ASSUMED THAT N IS OBTAINED FROM WORD 2 OF THE
                RECORD LABEL OR FROM THE IP3 INTERNAL DESCRIPTOR,
                DEPENDING ON THE VBIAS FILE TYPE.
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       SD     = FILE OF GRIDS OR ZONAL PROFILES OF SQUARE ROOTS OF
                UNBIASED ESTIMATES OF THE VARIANCE (IE, THE SQUARE ROOT
                OF THE SUM OF SQUARED DEVIATIONS DIVIDED BY N-1)
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 UNABLE TO READ FIRST SET
        2 MORE THAN ONE SIZE IN VBIAS
        3 FOUND TOO SMALL A VALUE OF N
