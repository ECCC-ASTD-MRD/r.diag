      DESCRIPTION...
       relabl - CHANGES COMPLETE LABELS IN A FILE
 
 
      AUTHOR  - N.Sargent, JUN 06/81.
      LAST REVISION: $Header: /home/cvs/RMNLIB/utils/rdiag/lspgm/relabl.ptn,v 4.16 2014/09/25 20:20:52 dugas Exp $
 
 
      PURPOSE - COPIES A FILE CHANGING LABELS WHERE INDICATED.
      NOTE    - ANY PART OF THE LABEL CAN BE CHANGED AND CHANGING
                  THE PACKING DENSITY CAUSES THE FIELD TO BE REPACKED.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       OLD = INPUT FILE TO BE CHANGED.
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
       NEW = COPY OF FILE OLD WITH SOME OF THE LABELS CHANGED.
 
 
      INPUT PARAMETERS...
 
       JBUF = LABEL TYPE(S) TO BE CHANGED. BLANK SUBFIELDS ARE IGNORED
              AND A BLANK CARD CAUSES ALL THE RECORD LABELS IN THE INPUT
              FILE TO BE CHANGED ACCORDING TO KBUF CARD SUBFIELD VALUES,
             (PROVIDED THE KBUF CARD IS NOT BLANK).
       KBUF = VALUES TO WHICH LABELS ARE TO BE CHANGED.
              NOTE THAT BLANK SUBFIELDS ARE NOT CHANGED.
 
       PLV  = VERTICAL LEVEL TYPE. ONLY USE THIS WITH RPN STD FILES AND
              WHEN JBUF4 AND KBUF4 CONTAIN DECODED VALUES. FURTHERMORE,
              THIS PARAMETRE CAN ONLY BE SPECIFIED IN COMMAND-LINE MODE.
              THE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED VALUES ARE:
 
               'HAUTEUR'   , heights (m) with respect to sea level
               'SIGMA'     , classical terrain following (0.0 -> 1.0)
               'ETA'       , first version of the GEM ETA coordinate
               'PRESSION'  , pressure (mb)
               'ARBITRAIRE', arbitrary level (no units apply)
               'HAUTEURS'  , heights (M) with respect to the surface
               'HYBRIDE'   , hybrid GEM coordinate
               'THETA'     , potential temperature coordinate
               'GALCHEN'   , GalChen generalized coordinate
 
              ONE OR TWO VALUES CAN BE SPECIFIED HERE. WHEN ONLY ONE IS
              DEFINED, IT SPECIFIES THE VERTICAL LEVEL TYPE OF THE FOURTH
              ELEMENTS OF JBUF AND KBUF VECTORS. WHEN TWO VALUES ARE GIVEN,
              THE FIRST IS APPLIED TO THE INPUT AND THE SECOND IS THE TYPE
              OF THE OUTPUT VERTICAL COORDINATE. 
 
              
       NOTES - 1) INPUT FILE RECORD LABELS REMAIN UNCHANGED IF ANY SUBFIELD
                  IN JBUF CARD DOES NOT MATCH THE CORRESPONDING SUBFIELD
                  READ OR IF THE KBUF CARD IS BLANK.
               2) LABELS ARE READ WITH ALPHANUMERIC FORMAT BUT CHANGED 
                  INTERNALLY TO THE NORMAL FORM OF (1X,A4,I10,1X,A4,5I8),
                  EXCEPT FOR THE VERTICAL LEVELS WHICH ARE FIRST CONVERTED
                  TO THEIR REAL UNCODED VALUES WITH A E10.0 FORMAT.
               3) KEYWORD INPUT IS AVAILABLE BY SPECIFYING THE JBUF AND 
                  KBUF VALUES IN SEQUENCE FOR THE REQUIRED KEYS. NO KEY
                  IS REQUIRED, BUT TWO VALUES ARE REQUIRED FOR EACH 
                  SPECIFIED KEY. QUOTED BLANK VALUES ARE LEGAL.
                  THE DEFAULT IN THIS MODE IS TO DO NOTHING.
 
       READ( 5,5010 ) JBUF
       READ( 5,5010 ) KBUF
 5010  FORMAT(11X,A4, I10,1X,A4,3I5,I10,I5)
