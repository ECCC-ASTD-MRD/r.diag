      PURPOSES - (MODE 1, DEFAULT, NO COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS) GENERATES
                  A FILE WHOSE VALUES ARE SET TO THE TIMESTEP VALUE AS
                  FOUND IN IBUF(2) FOR CCRN FILES AND IN IP3 FOR RPN
                  STANDARD FILES.
               - (MODE 2, "-def" OR "-def 0" COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS)
                  REPLACE THE TIMESTEP INFORMATION OF EACH SET BY ITS
                  ACTUAL ORDINAL IN THE FILE ITSELF.
               - (MODE 3, "-def 1"  COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT) AS IN
                  MODE 1, BUT ALWAYS USE IBUF(2). DO NOT USE IP3.
               - (MODE 4, "-def 2 -delt VALUE" ARGUMENTS) RESET
                  THE INTERNAL TIMESTEP DESCRIPTOR TO "VALUE"
                  (ONLY INSIDE RPN/CMC STANDARD FILES)
                  
 
      NOTES (APPLY ONLY TO MODES 1 AND 3)
                 -  FOR SPECTRAL TYPE FILES, ONLY THE REAL PART OF
                    THE (0,0) COEFFICIENT RECORD VALUES IS SET.
                 -  FOR CMPL TYPE FILES, ONLY THE REAL PART OF 
                    EACH WORD IS SET.
                 -  THIS INFO IS MAINLY USED TO DETERMINE SAMPLE
                    SIZES AS SAVED BY PROGRAMS SUCH AS TIMAVG OR
                    TIMCOV. FOR SQI FILES, THIS INFORMATION IS
                    USUALLY FOUND IN THE IP3 DESCRIPTOR.
 
 
      INPUT FILE...
       INF  = FILE CONTAINING RECORDS AT PRESSURE LEVEL(S), IT CAN BE
              OF TYPE SPECTRAL, ZONAL CROSS-SECTIONS, COMPLEX ARRAYS,
              SUBAREAS OR GLOBAL GRID(S).
 
      OUTPUT FILE...
      (MODES 1 AND 3) 
       TOUT = FILE OF THE SAME TYPE AS INF WITH THE VALUE(S) OF
              EACH RECORD SET EQUAL TO A MEASURE OF THE TIMESTEP
      (MODE 2)
       TOUT = FILE OF THE SAME TYPE AS INF WITH THE VALUE OF IBUF(2)
              SET TO THE TIME SET ORDINAL IN THE ORIGINAL FILE
      (MODE 4)
       TOUT = ACTUAL DATA UNCHANGED FROM INPUT EXCEPT FOR THE INTERNAL
              TIMESTEP DESCRIPTOR WHICH IS RESET TO THE DESIRED VALUE
 
 
      EXIT CONDITIONS...
        0 NO PROBLEMS
        1 PREMATURE EOF ON FILE INF
        2 UNKNOWN DATA TYPE
        3 PROBLEM READING VAL0
        4 UNABLE TO ALLOCATE ENOUGH WORKING MEMORY
